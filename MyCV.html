    <p>Personal development orientation : Wake up Early. Develop the habit to get up early. The age old proverb which says: “Early to bed and early to rise makes a man healthy, wealthy, and wise!” has been coined owing to the multiple benefits of an early riser. Some of these include: watching and enjoying the sun rise, do some early morning exercise for your fitness, being able to work on a project just because it’s important to you before the day officially gets started, and so on. In addition, studies show that early rises are happier, healthier, and more productive than their late rising counterparts.</p>
